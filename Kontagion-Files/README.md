# Kontagion Files

These are the project files of one of my assignments. I wrote studentworld.cpp,
studentworld.h, actor.cpp, and actor.h. The other files were provided by my
professor. This project was about using inheritance and polymorphism to implement
the classes needed for the game to run.
